# Overview 

Humanity is on an exponential journey to superintelligence which began with large language models (LLMs) and ChatGPT in 2023. By 2030, AI will be both inevitable and pervasive. For decades we've imagined software "agents" that can truly understand us, and that we trust enough to complete work for us. LLMs finally deliver these digital genies.

This book is your guide to the transformative impact AI agents, copilots, assistants, and digital knowledge workers on commerce, work and society.  As these agents form a new software layer, which will be known as agentware, we'll witness widespread automation of white collar business processes and changes to the very meaning of work. We'll all make trade-offs en route to hyper-productivity and hyper-personalization that frees us up from mundane tasks. Optomists see the cancer-curing innovations now possible, while pessimists see extraordinary job displacements occuring nearly overnight since we won't be ready to absorb these new superintelligent workers and pivot ourselves to other work.   

Our story starts with what is possible today and projects ahead to 2030. We follow Ana Patel, a determined and forward-thinking software engineer, who rises from Chief Platform Officer to CEO at MarketSphere.  She infuses AI into every business process in the global digital store. As superintelligence becomes scalable, MarketSphere augments it with its vast customer data and deploys hyper-productive and personalized customer relationship agents. No longer just copilots or assistants, MarketSphere's agents evolve to become trusted knowledge workers, capable of making real-time decisions as they respond to customer queries around the clock. The dynamics of commerce undergoes a revolutionary shift as these interactions are increasingly initiated by the customers' own AI agents, ushering in a new era of AI-driven commerce.  

A techno-optimist, Ana is recognized globally for envisioning and pioneering the first superintelligent Neural Lake, a new combination of data and AI agents that learn and self-improve in the cloud. Her path is uncharted and fraught with risk. Ana undergoes a personal transformation as she tackles heart-wrenching ethical and governance challenges, including the displacement of vast numbers of human resources. Amidst internal strife over rogue AI agents and external pressures for AI safety, ethics and privacy, she steers her company through the turbulent waters of an AI-centric, agentic, and hyper-personalized era. 

How does Ana navigate the most transformative digital decade that society and humanity has seen to date? What qualities made her the right leader for the role? What was the cost of her personal transformation? 

Experience Ana's tumultuous journey at the AI frontier and gain insights for your own personal and business strategies.
