# Preface

## My Journey From Business Intelligence to Artificial Intelligence 

It seems years ago but ChatGPT hit my consciousness like a flash of bright light less than a year ago, around December 2022.   

My journey with technology began as one of the early programmers in the Commodore-64 era (a combination of Assembly Language, BASIC and other languages of the day). I chose to apply my passion for technological change in a business career that took me through complex technology implementations during the growth phases of PwC and Deloitte. My colleagues and I optimistically referred to our projects as 'business transformation programs', as we delivered new business intelligence capabilities and invested months redesigning business processes and led organizational change programs. From Assembly Language, to ERP & BI, SaaS startups, data warehouses, data quality governance, NoSQL, blockchain and now AI, closed and open source Large Language Models, and a plethora of APIs. It's been a thrilling journey, and it's not over yet.       

When I first heard about ChatGPT, I was pre-occupied with an existing platform venture so I saw ChatGPT as a novelty that I would eventually try out. I've been known to be an early blogger, a very early Twitter(X) and LinkedIn user -- it was natural that I test drive this new technology.

A few months later, I was convinced this was a digital knowledge worker tsunami that had the power to transform every aspect of our businesses and personal lives.  

Reflecting on a few examples, my early experiences with ChatGPT created a feeling nothing short of amazement. I had heard about its ability to play an interactive role. I recall asking ChatGPT to act like a famously successful entrepreneur, by "prompting" it to give me advice on solving my existing business challenges. It came up with solid business school level ideas. With some basic background information and prompting, it was actually able to come up with very good business plan rationale, strategies and actions. 

I then asked ChatGPT to act as an author of some of favourite books and prompted it to teach me about the key insights in these books.  It was amazing how it felt to, almost, be speaking to the real author herself/himself. From high level insights to deeper discussions of the content, ChatGPT tirelessly shared its knowledge, and took on the role of the author.  I experienced many "chat with this book" moments with classic books and modern ones as well. I didn't know how the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) was "trained" but it didn't matter - it just worked.   

Althought it was only trained on knowledge up to September 2021 at the time and didn't have access to the internet for updates, it seemed to know and be able to explain pretty much everything about our universe.  

It could write -- or generate -- poetry, emails or pretty much any text-based content on demand. It was clearly going to augment or displace writers. 

And it was amazing that it understood most English natural language prompts and their nuanced contexts.

I had heard the Khan Academy was an early collaborator and that it would embed a ChatGPT-powered "super tutor" into its platform. I began to believe it was possible that teachers needed to become ChatGPT-literate. 

I asked ChatpGPT to generate some basic software code and it did it flawlessly. It even converted python to javascript on demand. I began to understand why some AI experts declared that "English is the next programming language". Github has called it's pair programming service "Github Copilot".

Yes, it would occasionally make things up -- hallucinate -- and this could be a major risk in real world busines applications and a huge benefit in the creative arts such as script writing. 

Some still call ChatpGPT a dumb, recursive next word generator but what I've seen is not the programmed chatbot that you would find on websites pre-2023.

This is a novel form of on-demand, all-knowing, creative artificial intelligence. It is helpful, somewhat friendly, and even seems programmed to be eager to respond to my every prompt. 

As open source projects came alive, I played with early versions of Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, and other agents. I saw how one agent with an objective, could define a set of tasks and then carry them out. Early days to be sure, but this was next level simulated reasoning and automation.
I had the same feeling of important change in the dotcom era and, to a great degree, of smart contracts.

OpenAI then released plug-ins, and Code Interpreter, a sandboxed environment that could write code and then execute it. This definitely has the potential to disrupt the data science field.

In other news, Meta released an open source Large Language Model, and the race was on to fill the HuggingFace community with all kinds of new models.   

I obviously needed to know more.

Going deeper, I built apps with OpenAI's backend API's; an AI business analyzer that would accept business information and return full business strategies and models; and an app that would ingest and summarize the firehose of AI information being published daily.  

After dedicating my spring and summer months of 2023 to researching the broad AI field, to the point of it being an obsession, it dawned on me that this would literally be a transformational inflection point for enterprise applications and knowledge management. Around that time, McKinsey, EY, BCG and other professional services firms started announcing major investments into Large Language Models and their own versions of ChatGPT for their staff and clients.

The race inside the pure knowledge services firms was on. 

If you're reading this, I assume you already appreciate how significant AI is in 2023. While it may have taken 10 years to get here from the early days of ImageNet, I expect you agree the speed of research, innovation and scale of the change we've seen so far in 2023 is nothing short of incredible.

Now, as I reflect on the past few decades of my financial and tech-focused career, I've often considered capturing in book form the technological changes transforming us. Building products and solutions, however, always took priority so I made the time for long blog posts and many confererences to share points of view. We had the dotcom era -- Web1 -- when we could write to the web logs (blogs) and transact in e-commcerce. Then the Web2 companies monetized our attention with social media and cloud-based tech giants emerged. Finally, the emergence of Web3, digital currencies and digital asset "tokens" and "DeFi" was enabled by distributed and decentralized blockchain technologies. Smart contracts have the power to create efficient trading markets for digital assets as well as "real world" assets such as real estate, and I co-founded a platform that would eventually bring real world assets onchain. With the rather unfortunate crises of a few very bad "crypto" actors being exposed in 2022, the real Web3 evolution has slowed but is still under development to this day.  

The big nudge to write a book came in the summer one day with the realization that we're truly experiencing a new generation of software applications. Multi-modal digital assistants (or co-pilots, AI employees, digital knowledge workers), all inspired by ChatGPT, are driving a whole new set of "Generative AI" use cases that promise massive productivity gains. 

Imagine having an infinite number of contact centre AI agents in your enterprise cloud, interacting with your customers, taking their prompts and carrying out their wishes.  Innovating companies are offering these products now and enterprise leaders are planning out their digital process transformations as we speak.

Riffing off the term 'software', I see a new category of 'agentware' transforming enterprises of all sizes in the coming years. I firmly believe that those who don't employ them may not be competitive enough to be around. Agentware for customer contact centres, marketing, sales, supply chain management, finance, and more.    

Just like driving cars, agents need a "human-in-the-loop" today, but in the near future they'll be autonomous workers with the able to identify and complete complex tasks.

It's incredibly challenging to predict the future, but with the help of experts in the field, I'll give it a go.

Here's my plan: research the roadmaps of actual products in the market today, discuss it with the foremost leaders in the space and extrapolate it in a responsible way.

To make it accessible, my objective is to write a futuristic view of today's agentware roadmaps in the setting of a fictional story of a company that incoporates 'agentware' technology in everything it does. We'll be set in 2025 and the leader and her team will have their share of challenges of course, so let's see how they work it all out.      

### "Agentware" 
The book's working title is ***"Agentware - The Coming Revolution Automating the Future of Work and Society"***, a futuristic look into how agentware will transform how we work and live.   

I'll be publishing draft chapters at https://github.com/alanwunsche/agentware-book and hope you'll share your constructive feedback.

Just know that this is already feeling like a science fiction book, taking what we see now and imperfectly projecting out a story into the future. 

Finally, while this first draft of the Author's Preface was not assisted by ChatGPT, I definitely plan to give ChatGPT co-author credit as the story unfolds.

Let's now take a step into 2030!
