> "We believe intelligence is the ultimate engine of progress. Intelligence makes everything better. Smart people and smart societies outperform less smart ones on virtually every metric we can measure. Intelligence is the birthright of humanity; we should expand it as fully and broadly as we possibly can."

> Marc Andreesen. Excerpts from The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. October 16, 2023.
